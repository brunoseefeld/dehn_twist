\begin{abstract}
The goal of this "note" is to have written down a lot of results (old and new)
about twists and Dehn twists, specifically Dehn twists on $\mathbb{T}^2$


\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

I'll put the definitions here, that is: foliation by circles, Dehn twists,
twists. Every result can be put into a section, the order does not matter,
the important thing is to have things written down and not just hand waved in past
meetings with Alejandro.
